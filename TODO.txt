* Job unlimited

    - No pilot job:
            - 1 job / 1 task
            - A-priori clustering (Chen et al.):  n tasks -> 1 sequential task:    1 job / 1 task
            - clustering de task into jobs:
                    - choose job shape based on queue-wait time prediction
                    - whatever tasks make sense in a job

    - Pilot job:
            - Keith Cooper (level-by-level)
            - Queue-aware pilot job, dynamic-scheduling: heuristic to submit appropriate pilot jobs

    - Scheduler effect overhead (to deal with submitting too many jobs)


* If jobs are limited, what do we do?


Much later: data transfers
